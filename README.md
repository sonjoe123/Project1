## Introduction
This assignment involves building a sentiment classifier for tweets. The goal is to determine whether a tweet expresses positive or negative sentiment based on its content. The classifier is trained using a dataset of pre-classified tweets and then tested on another set of tweets to evaluate its performance.

## Functions Overview
1. **Training Phase**: Analyze the frequency of words in the training tweets to develop a classification scheme.
2. **Testing Phase**: Predict the sentiment of testing tweets using the classification scheme developed during training.
3. **DSString and DSVector Classes**: Implement custom string and vector classes for efficient storage and manipulation of strings and counters.
4. **Classifier Results Output**: Generate an output file containing the classifier's predictions for the testing dataset.
5. **Accuracy and Errors Output**: Generate an output file containing the classifier's accuracy and misclassifications.

## Running the Program
To run the program, use the following command-line arguments:
