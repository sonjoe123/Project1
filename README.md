## My Personal Project: Sentiment Analysis for Tweets

### Introduction
In this personal project, I aim to build a sentiment classifier for tweets. The goal is to develop a system capable of determining whether a tweet expresses positive or negative sentiment based on its content. To achieve this, I'll leverage machine learning techniques and a dataset of pre-classified tweets.

### Functions Overview
1. **Training Phase**: Analyze the frequency of words in the training tweets to develop a classification scheme.
2. **Testing Phase**: Predict the sentiment of testing tweets using the classification scheme developed during training.
3. **Custom String and Vector Classes**: Implement custom string and vector classes (DSString and DSVector) for efficient storage and manipulation of strings and counters.
4. **Classifier Results Output**: Generate an output file containing the classifier's predictions for the testing dataset.
5. **Accuracy and Errors Output**: Generate an output file containing the classifier's accuracy and misclassifications.

### Running the Program
To run the program, use the following command-line arguments:
